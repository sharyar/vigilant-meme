    "1. A linear regression model to represent the number of observed mosquitoes given a number of weather features. \n",

    "1. Additional logic had to be added to resolve the 'time grid' utilized by the two sets of data. Where the Mosquito Trap Data was sampled at a frequency of one data point per week, Edmonton Weather data was sampled once every hour. \n",
    "2. Because Edmonton weather data is an instantaneous measure at the recorded time, some kind of aggregation of the weather data is desired to better match the Mosquito Trap data, such as the utilization and calculation of a moving average for certain features in the weather data set (humidity, temp, dew point, wind_dir_10s, wind_speed, health_index)\n",
    "3. Within both data sets, some features have inconsistent data and therefore was ignored from the analysis. Columns with limited or no data, such as visibility, cloud cover, humidex, windchill and solar radiation were identified as unncessary to our analysis, and was removed. Similarly, rows with missing data points were also removed from our analysis.\n",
    "4. For the Edmonton Mosquito Trap data, rows marked with UnID from the IDd column represented bad data and were removed from the analysis. "
